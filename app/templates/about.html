<h3>Background</h3>
<p>It is often said that Western countries are becoming increasingly polarised
societies, with this polarisation occuring around politically-charged
issues like climate change and immigration.</p>

<h3>Understanding social phenomena through agent-based models</h3>
<p>One way to understand a phenomenon of interest is through modelling. To create
a model involves making some good guesses about the processes that are
central to the phenomenon in order to recreate it at a smaller
scale. This can be done computationally, although it need not be. One example of
a non-computational or "physical" model is that of the Mississipi
Delta which was built by the U.S. Army Engineer Corps, and used in
order to simulate and better understand flooding in that region. By carefully
tweaking the objects representing parts of the <em>real</em> Mississipi Delta,
engineers were able to understand how its flow would likely behave under a range
of real-world conditions. Nowadays, however most models are computational.
</p>
<p>Despite their complexity, social phenomena are also apt for modelling. Most
often this is achieved by what is called an "agent-based model" or
<strong>ABM</strong>. Traditional or process-based models usually simulate a
phenomenon through the application of laws which are assumed to accurately
describe the processes that drive change in those phenomena, usually represented
by differential equations. By contrast, ABMs include a number of <em>agents</em>
which interact with eachother and objects in the model according to a set of
guidelines. For example, an ABM of wealth accumulation may consist of agents
which gain a set amount of income during each cycle or "tick" of the model and
who have a variable chance of losing this income to other agents when they
encounter them.</p>
<p>Despite the way in which ABMs idealise and abstract away from messy and
complex social processes, they have the potential to provide insight if they are
appropriately paired with empirical investigation. For example, a good ABM
might demonstrate how a complex phenomenon could emerge from just a few simpler
processes, or how a certain kind of social system will always tend towards a
certain kind of state. However, it is difficult in any particular case to know
how general such lessons are in the absence of an indication of the robustness
of the assumptions that go into the ABM.</p>

<h3>The dissemination of culture: local convergence and global polarisation</h3>
<p>You can find here an implementation of an ABM of social
polarisation. The model was initially proposed by the political scientist
Robert Axelrod (1997).</p>
