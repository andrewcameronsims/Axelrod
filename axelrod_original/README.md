# An implementation of Axelrod's model of social polarisation

I wrote this small script to demonstrate the role that *agent-based
models* (ABMs) can play in explaining social phenomena. I got interested
in social polarisation as a spectator of the political polarisation in 
the U.S. between liberals and conservatives. These two groups have their
own cultures and information ecosystems, and I was curious as to how
this could occur. I came across a paper by a political scientist by the
name of Robert Axelrod who designed a simulation of polarisation showing
that it could occur on a large-scale only through small-scale imitation. 
This was my attempt to implement that model for educative purposes and 
to myself practice some object-oriented programming. In future I intend
to convert it onto a small interactive webpage where the user can themselves
run the simulation in the browser.
